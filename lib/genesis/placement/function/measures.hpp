/**
 * @brief Calculates the normalized distance between two plain pqueries. It is mainly a helper
 * method for distance calculations (e.g., pairwise distance, variance).
 *
 * For each placement in the two pqueries, a distance is calculated, and their normalized sum is
 * returned. Normalization is done using the mass of placements in both pqueries.
 *
 * The distance between two placements is calculated as the shortest path between them. This
 * includes the their position on the branches, and - if specified - the pendant_length of both.
 * There are three cases that might occur:
 *
 *   1. **Both placements are on the same branch.**
 *      In this case, their distance is caluclated as their difference in proximal_lengths (plus
 *      if specified the sum of their pendant_lengths).
 *
 *   2. **The path between the placements includes the root.**
 *      The distance of a placement from its neighbouring nodes is usually given in form of the
 *      proximal_length, which is the distance of the placement to the node (at the end of its
 *      branch) that lies in direction of the root. Thus, there is an implicit notion of a root,
 *      that we need to consider. If the path between two placements contains the root, we can
 *      directly calculate their distance as the distance between the two promixal nodes plus
 *      proximal_lengths (and possibly pendant_lengths) of both placements. We call this the
 *      promixal-promixal case.
 *
 *   3. **The root is not part of the path between the placements.**
 *      This case means that one of the two placements lies on the path between the other placement
 *      and the root -- thus, the path between the placements does not contain the root.
 *      The distance between the placements cannot be calculated using the proximal_lengths
 *      directly, but we need to get the distal_length (away from the root) of the inner placement
 *      first. This is simply the difference between branch_length and proximal_length of that
 *      placement. Of course, this case comes in two flavours, because both placements can be the
 *      inner or outer one. They are called proximal-distal case and distal-proximal case,
 *      respectively.
 *
 * The first case is easy to detect by comparing the edge nums. However, distinguishing between the
 * latter two cases is expensive, as it involves finding the path to the root for both placements.
 * To speed this up, we instead use a distance matrix that is calculated in the beginning of any
 * algorithm using this method and contains the pairwise distances between all nodes of the tree.
 * Using this, we do not need to find paths between placements, but simply go to the nodes at the
 * end of the branches of the placements and do a lookup for those nodes.
 *
 * With this technique, we can calculate the distances between the placements for all
 * three cases (promixal-promixal, proximal-distal and distal-proximal) cheaply. The wanted distance
 * is then simply the minimum of those three distances. This is correct, because the two wrong cases
 * will always produce an overestimation of the distance.
 *
 * This distance is normalized using the `like_weight_ratio` of both placements, before
 * summing it up to calculate the total distance between the pqueries.

/**
 * @brief Calculate the variance of the placements on a tree.
 *
 * The variance is a measure of how far a set of items is spread out in its space
 * (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/variance). In many cases, it can be measured using the mean of the
 * items. However, when considering placements on a tree, this does not truly measure how far they
 * are from each other. Thus, this algorithm applies a different method of calculating the variance
 * in terms of squared deviations of all items from each other:
 * \f$ Var(X) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{2}(x_i - x_j)^2 \f$,
 * where \f$ (x_i - x_j) \f$ denotes the distance between two placements.
 *
 * According to the formula above, each pair of placements is evaluated twice, and subsequently
 * their distance need to be halfed when being added to the sum of distanaces. Instead of that,
 * we calculate the distance for each pair only once, thus are able skip half the calculations, and
 * of course skip the division by two.
 *
 * Furthermore, the normalizing factor \f$ \frac{1}{n^2} \f$ of the variance usually contains the
 * number of elements being processed. However, as the placements are weighted by their
 * `like_weight_ratio`, we instead calculate `n` as the sum of the `like_weight_ratio` of all
 * placements. In case that for each pquery the ratios of all its placements sum up to 1.0, this
 * number will be equal to the number of pqueries (and thus be equal to the usual case of using the
 * number of elements). However, as this is not required (placements with small ratio can be
 * dropped, so that their sum per pquery is less than 1.0), we cannout simply use the count.
